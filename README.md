##Concept:
Loyalties of Lucifer is a loyalty program for Lucifer Coffee Roasters. With the loyalty program, loyal customers can earn match sticks (points) when they complete challenges. Those match sticks can be spent on different rewards. To actually claim these rewards, visit one of the locations of Lucifer Coffee Roasters and show the barista what reward you would like to use.

##Getting started:
To use the loyalty program visit the website: https://i450256.hera.fhict.nl. The customer needs to create an account and sign in with this account. In the navigation bar, the customer can see how many points are earned.

*Collecting points:
To collect points, the customer should go to the challenges page and check what challenge the customer would like to do. For example, order a coffee. Click on the button and you will see some instructions and how many points you can earn. Then the customer should click on the button "scan NFC tag" and let the barista add the points to the customer's account. The collected points will then be added to your account.

*Getting rewards:
To get a reward, the customer goes to the rewards page and chooses a reward they would like. If the customer doesn't have enough points, you will get a notification. If the customer does have enough points, the points will be taken off of the total points they have. The reward can be found in the customerâ€™s profile page.

*Using rewards:
To use one of the rewards, the customer goes to the profile page. At the bottom of the page are the claimed rewards. The customer clicks on the reward and will be asked to confirm or cancel. The to be claimed reward needs to be shown to the barista, then click confirm. When the customer clicks "confirm" a timer will start. After time has run out, the reward will expire and can not be used anymore. The barista will give the reward.

*About the NFC tag:
The loyal customer needs to go to one of the locations of Lucifer Coffee Roasters and show the barista the created profile. The barista will load the customer's information on the personal NFC tag. The NFC tag is a sticker that the customer can attach to anything. With the NFC tag, the customer can now collect points when finishing a challenge.
In case the customer did forget to bring the NFC tag, the barista can manually add collected points to the account.

*For the barista:
An extra page was created for the staff. On this page, the staff can access the interactions with the NFC-tag. The information needs of the order needs to be put in. Then the barista needs the customer's NFC-tag to add the points.

##What is NFC :
Near Field Communication (NFC) technology allows users to make secure transactions, exchange digital content, and connect electronic devices with a touch. NFC transmissions are short range (from a touch to a few centimetres) and require the devices to be in close proximity.! 

*How do you set up NFC?
For Android:
Open the Settings app.
Tap Connections.
Tap NFC and contactless payments.
Tap the switch to turn NFC on.
Tap Contactless payments.
Select your preferred mobile payment service and follow the on-screen instructions to finish setting it up.
